# Sunset the legacy domain and Coach

Date: 2026-10-26. Status: accepted. Supersedes product use of ADR 0001, ADR 0002 and ADR 0004.

## Decision

Bearing is greenfield on V1. `/app` mounts the V1 workflow only. There is no `Item` → `V1Item` conversion, no import job, and no third Prisma client. Shared identity stays on `User`, theme stays on `Setting`, and audit stays on `OperationLedger` (V1 `Ledger` maps to that table). New product work goes through `src/lib/v1/*`, `prisma/v1`, and `/api/v1`.

## What already covers each legacy surface

| Legacy surface | V1 coverage | This change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/lib/domain` Item, Link, Project, backup, leases, write caps | `src/lib/v1/service.ts`, `workflow.ts`, `backup.ts`, `connected-service.ts` | Delete. Git history is the archive. Do not restore it under `src/`. |
| Legacy Coach tools, `/api/coach`, `src/lib/coach` | `src/lib/v1/coach/*` and `/api/v1/coach` | Delete. The feature flag goes with it. |
| Pre-V1 pages (`Shell`, ontology views, item editor) | `src/components/bearing/workflow/*` | Delete the unmounted shells. Keep Focus timer, Graph explorer, rich text, drafts, layout and icons that V1 still renders. |
| `src/lib/dates.ts` | `src/lib/v1/dates.ts` and `workflow-dates.ts` | Delete. It had no V1 caller. |
| `/api/items`, `/api/projects`, `/api/inbox`, and the other pre-V1 write/read routes | `/api/v1/*` | Remove the handlers. `LegacyApi` answers `410` so callers see a dated sunset instead of a silent data path. |
| `/api/seed` when V1 is on | Per-account Settings demo (`V1Demo`) | Keep a stub that always returns `410` and does not write. |
| `/api/preferences/theme`, `/api/receipts/:id`, `/api/auth/*` | Still used by V1 appearance, draft receipt links, and sign-in | Keep. They use `User`, `Setting`, or `OperationLedger` through `src/lib/db.ts`. |
| Legacy tables `Item`, `Project`, `Link`, `Domain`, `Tag`, `TagOnItem`, `HabitLog`, `Review`, `ReviewItem`, `Reminder` | Replaced by `V1*` tables. Foundations tests still prove a pre-existing `Item` row is not converted. | Leave the tables. Do not add a migration in this change. |

## Why no new schema

Dropping those tables is a destructive migration. Production may still hold rows, and this change does not prove those rows are empty. `User`, `Setting`, and `OperationLedger` are still live. A conversion migration would invent the mapping the product decision forbids. No new table or client is required to stop serving the old write stack.

## Dated drop

On or after **2027-01-26**, a separate PR may `DROP` only the unused legacy content tables listed above, after a production row-count review. That PR must not drop or rewrite `User`, `Setting`, or `OperationLedger`, and it must not copy rows into `V1*`. Until then, schema comments and `src/lib/db.ts` mark those models as do-not-extend.

## Smallest diff

Subtract callers first. Do not grow `src/lib/domain`. Do not leave a parallel domain module that the next change could import. V1 patterns stay as they are.
